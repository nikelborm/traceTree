TODO for me personally: check how it's different from `~/projects/tango-advisor/backend/src/tools/private/traceTree`

This library allows devs to record smart traces of functions and beatifully render them. There is still a lot of work to be done, I hope I'll do it at some point. If you like this library, give it a star, it REALLY motivates me to work on this
